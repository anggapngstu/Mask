/**
* Additional Information:
*
* This template allows you to segment textures based on the user's physical face mask, 
* as well as call triggers depending on whether the user is using a face mask or not. 
* 
* This template is based on the Classification Template. To learn more about triggering effects
* based on whether the user is wearing a mask or not, check out the guide here: 
* https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/classification/
*
* To segment a texture based on face mask, use `mask ML Proxy Texture` as an Opacity Texture to your material.
* Take a look at the `pattern-image`, and `mask-wavy` object for an example.
* Learn more about using segmentation texture here:
